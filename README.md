# Project idea: 
A file management system with a windows app and a web client that can store data quickly and allow quick download to any pc.

- Web server - used to signup/login. allowes to manually upload files to the cloud and download them + configure sync settings.
- App - no gui python instance that updates local files when changed in the cloud, has a signiture so you dont have to enter password.


- Encryptions: make sure the files are encrypted and compressed when uploaded in a way that only the original user can decode.
- Storage: support most popular files and zips them automatically for better performance.

## Hardest part: the windows app will be very hard to make. it will need an installer and admin priv to change registry level files.

I will start with a proof of concept to make sure the hardest parts are possible. it will be minimalistic. then ill create the api - the web server and lastly the app.

New things ill have to learn: sqlite3, node.js, html, css, electron.js windows, ++++.

I think this project if executed to the fullest will take over 400h.
